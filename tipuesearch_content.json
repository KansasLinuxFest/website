Linux is part of a powerful computer operating system that is distributed at no cost as an alternative to Windows or Apple OSX. Many devices from Internet servers to cable boxes to mission critical systems run Linux. Linux is developed collaboratively worldwide by companies and individual volunteers. Linux was started by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The GNU Project was started in 1984 by Richard Stallman, and replaces commercial UNIX software with all free and open source software. What is Free/Libre open source software? Free and open source software is software whose source code is open and available to anyone who wishes to improve it, study it, modify it, and share the original and the modifications with others.","tags":"Press","loc":"http://kansaslinuxfest.us/pages/press.html","title":"Press"},{"text":"Calendar The schedule is hosted on http://lanyrd.com/2015/klf15/schedule/ Schedule for Kansas Linux Fest on Lanyrd","tags":"Main","loc":"http://kansaslinuxfest.us/pages/schedule.html","title":"Schedule"},{"text":"Fifty OneFifty kansas based hacker/podcaster/linux guy \"How to Get Yourself On an Open Source Podcast\" Hal Gottfried https://keybase.io/hal9k james o keating james at okeating.net Alan Robertson alanr@unix.sh http://assimilationsystems.com Jonathan George jonathan@jdg.net Wichita \"Crowdfunding, open source, and you.

Linux Certifications I will be discussing the different types of certifications available for Linux, as well as diving into the requirements for each certification, training paths and costs. My goal is twofold, one to educate the community on the different certification paths, and two to provide information on the most cost-effective way to get certified.

Jeff Roberson JeffR@hutchgov.com Network Administrator City of Hutchinson www.hutchgov.com I'm the network administrator for the City of Hutchinson and we are running sipXecs which is based on Freeswitch. We have around 250 phones on the system and I didn't know if it would be fitting to have a talk about how the network here was built out to support VoIP as well as a discussion about Asterisk vs Freeswitch and how we decided to use one over the other. I could also discuss the merits of Asterisk and Freeswitch and how one would work better in different situations. Craig Comstock Open Hardware hacking GSM network security hacking via Osmocom Ben C.
