Kansas Linux Fest is a new festival of Free/Libre Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge. The Kansas Linux Fest will be held for the first time on the 21st and 22nd of March 2015, in Lawrence Kansas. The goal is to establish a yearly conference where members of the F/LOSS community can meet and share for the Heartland. The next closest Linux Fest is in Ohio and there is no other within 12 hours driving from here. Kansas Linux Fest is organized into two days of talks and workshops in parallel. We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their work. Speakers should be judged by a committee represented by local and international F/LOSS/OK/OH KLF 2015 accepts research papers, industry papers, formal tool demonstrations, lightning talks, new ideas, experience reports, and posters. KLF 2015 also invites proposals for tutorials and workshops, and submissions of panels. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which are published online. Topics FLOSS : Free/Libre Open Source Software We are looking for contributions on current trends and development in all areas of Free and Open Source Software, trending new F/LOSS software packages FLOSS technologies, specially those taking advantage of being FLOSS Motivation and incentives to FLOSS development and adoption Business models based on FLOSS and sustainability of FLOSS projects Impact of FLOSS in specific domains or technological areas, and FLOSS adoption Measurement of significant parameters related to FLOSS Open standards, open data, open cloud, open hardware and open exhibits Economic, organizational and social issues on F/LOSS Software development Architecture and design of F/LOSS FLOSS development, including software engineering aspects New experiences with F/LOSS development tools and practices F/LOSS and traditional vs. Agile development methods F/LOSS and decentralized development Reuse in F/LOSS Architecture and design of F/LOSS Operating systems Linux and open source operating system distributions kernel module development tuning of operating systems Driver or library development for embedded systems Linux Kernel Development System Administration Interoperability, portability, scalability of F/LOSS cfengine, puppet, chef, salt, ansible and similar tools Mission-Critical, Real-Time, and Long Life Systems Filesystems And Storage (Long-Term Archiving, Client-Server Filesystems, Compression) Cloud F/LOSS in the cloud F/LOSS in cloud-based applications F/LOSS environments for cloud computing Cloud Containers Cloud Hypervisors Cloud Distributed Services IT security Security of F/LOSS New Research, tools, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits. local hackers who find innovative tech/non-tech solutions for real-life challenges. known security issues, case studies, twist to an existing research, tool, vulnerability, exploit or research-in-progress security tools Comprises of open source security tools, exploits, frameworks etc. Security aspects of Software Coding, Configuration, Testing Malware F/LOSS platforms and toolkits/Applications F/LOSS for data management and analysis F/LOSS business intelligence toolkits F/LOSS business packages (CRM, ERP, HRM) F/LOSS collaboration and communication environments F/LOSS over the Internet F/LOSS for entertainment F/LOSS for graphics design F/LOSS for 3d animation Software Quality Dynamic F/LOSS verification: F/LOSS testing, debugging, type of tests, use of test suits Static F/LOSS verification - software analysis Formal F/LOSS verification Detection of bad coding practices and adoption of coding conventions F/LOSS metrics: measuring F/LOSS performance, safety, and quality F/LOSS performance Standardization of verification activities and availability of verification results Mobile/Embedded Embedded Systems (Phones and Tablets, Automotive and Self-driving, Yocto, Wearables) Mobile Operating Systems: ROMs, custom images, custom kernels Open Source apps for mobile devices Open Source app markets and software delivery platforms Software metrics for Open Source mobile software Energy efficiency and green solutions in Mobile F/LOSS Software development process for Open Source mobile software Wearable technologies Internet of Everything (Smart Grid, Smart Home, Medical Systems, Environmental Systems) Desktop Porting Proprietary Software to Linux desktop Hardware With Linux Preinstalled Wine and Emulators Influencing Proprietary Companies Review of Linux desktop software Open Knowledge Not just software itself but open knowledge and data are a topic of the conferences.

The Free/Libre Open Source and Open Knowledge Association of Kansas is a new organization in Kansas started with the goal of promoting Free/Libre Open Source Software and Open Knowledge in the state of Kansas. There are a large number of groups in Kansas and the surrounding areas, the FLOSOKAKS will work with them together and aims to create a state wide organization that has members who represent all local groups. You will find a list of groups that we will contact and invite to participate here : http://www.openkansas.us/hacklabscomputer-clubs What is Kansas Linux Fest?

We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their work. Demand for a conference The F/LOSS community continues to grow, and in Kansas and the surrounding states there is a large amount of activity. The adoption rate of Linux and F/LOSS software is high. The high demand for people with F/LOSS expertise shows that we need to do more here in Kanas to raise awareness about the benefits of this great community. Goals for the conference We want to create a yearly event that helps strengthen the F/LOSS community here in Kansas. Keep costs down for attendees We want to have a free event so that people will not have to pay for entrance fee. We will ask for voluntary donations. Any excess funds from the conference will be used to buy food and drinks for the group. Spending Sponsors help pay for marketing, t-shirts, event space, even coffee/tea and lunches if enough funds are available. We will consider helping pay travel expenses for contributors who otherwise would not be able to attend. Marketing We plan on doing marketing to get the word out, print advertising in regional newspapers, media press releases, posters, online (google, twitter, facebook, linked in) as well as organic marketing efforts. We think that promotion and marketing is very important for the conference and we want to do a great job on that. We will also be printing up posters and flyers to distribute at the cities, schools and universities in Kansas. Design We want to have teeshirts printed and have a nice design for them, ideally for the website as well. We are looking for help on the design side and do not yet have a designer on the project. Website We will want to get ssl certificates and also hosting for a dynamic website for managing the registration of guests, speaker, talks and schedules. Until then we will continue with a static website hosted on github. Sponsorship levels Platinum — USD $3,000 — Gold — USD $2,000 — Silver — USD $1,000 — Your logo or name on the conference shirt (one color only), plus the benefits below. Bronze — USD $250 — Your logo or name in the information booklet and on the webpage page. Your sponsorship is also mentioned by name during Saturday morning's plenary session. Expo Tables We have very limited space for expo tables in the conference room where the talks will be, there we will have some tables on the wall, but that wont have the expo table like atmosphere.
