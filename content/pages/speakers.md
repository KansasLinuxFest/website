Linux Certifications
I will be discussing the different types of certifications available for Linux, as well
as diving into the requirements for each certification, training paths and costs.

My goal is twofold, one to educate the community on the different certification paths, and
two to provide information on the most cost-effective way to get certified. (with as little money as possible!)

##Jeff Roberson

Network Administrator
City of Hutchinson
www.hutchgov.com

I'm the network administrator for the City of Hutchinson and we are running sipXecs which is based on Freeswitch. We have around 250 phones on the system and I didn't know if it would be fitting to have a talk about how the network here was built out to support VoIP as well as a discussion about Asterisk vs Freeswitch and how we decided to use one over the other. I could also discuss the merits of Asterisk and Freeswitch and how one would work better in different situations.
