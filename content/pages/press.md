What is GNU/Linux? Linux is part of a powerful computer operating system that is distributed at no cost as an alternative to Windows or Apple OSX. Many devices from Internet servers to cable boxes to mission critical systems run Linux. Linux is developed collaboratively worldwide by companies and individual volunteers. Linux was started by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The GNU Project was started in 1984 by Richard Stallman, and replaces commercial UNIX software with all free and open source software.

What is Free/Libre open source software? Free and open source software is
software whose source code is open and available to anyone who wishes to
improve it, study it, modify it, and share the original and the modifications
with others.
