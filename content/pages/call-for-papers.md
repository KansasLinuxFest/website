##What is Kansas GNU/Linux Fest?
Kansas GNU/Linux Fest is a new festival of Free/Libre Software, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge.

The Kansas GNU/Linux Fest will be held for the first time on the 21st and 22nd of March 2015, in Lawrence Kansas. The goal is to establish a yearly conference where members of the F/LOSS community can meet and share for the Heartland. The next closest GNU/Linux Fest is in Ohio and there is no other within 12 hours driving from here.
Kansas GNU/Linux Fest is organized into two days of talks and workshops in parallel. We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their work.

Speakers should be judged by a committee represented by local and international F/LOSS/OK/OH

KLF 2015 accepts research papers, industry papers, formal tool demonstrations, lightning talks, new ideas, experience reports, and posters. KLF 2015 also invites proposals for tutorials and workshops,  and submissions of panels.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which are published online.

## We will pick speakers in this priority :
We will have a board of reviewers for the papers and fairly pick the speakers
in a transparent manner.
1. National and International F/LOSS/open knowledge/open hardware speakers.
2. Status reports from local and regional hacklabs/lugs/makerspaces etc
3. Local regional developers presenting projects they are working on.

## Schedule
See [Schedule Page](/pages/schedule.html)

## Venue

We have a green room in the auditorium that could serve as a ready
room. We have two wireless lavaliere mics and a handheld wireless mic
in the auditorium as well as a projector and screen. In Meeting Room C
we have a big screen TV that can be connected to a laptop. The room is
small enough a mic set up isn't necessary.
