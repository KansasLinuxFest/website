##What is Kansas Linux Fest?
Kansas Linux Fest is a new festival of Free/Libre Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge.

The Kansas Linux Fest will be held for the first time on the 21st and 22nd of March 2015, in Lawrence Kansas. The goal is to establish a yearly conference where members of the F/LOSS community can meet and share for the Heartland. The next closest Linux Fest is in Ohio and there is no other within 12 hours driving from here.
Kansas Linux Fest is organized into two days of talks and workshops in parallel. We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their work.

Speakers should be judged by a committee represented by local and international F/LOSS/OK/OH

KLF 2015 accepts research papers, industry papers, formal tool demonstrations, lightning talks, new ideas, experience reports, and posters. KLF 2015 also invites proposals for tutorials and workshops,  and submissions of panels.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which are published online.

### Open Hardware
### Open Knowlege

    Mapping the movement: What histories can illuminate current open data practice? How should we understand the idea of an open data movement? What can research tell us about the future directions a movement might take?
    Open data impacts: What impact is open data having in different fields? What methods can be used to trace the impacts of open data?
    Open data and grassroots communities: What is the impact of open data on grassroots communities, how do they integrate and influence into the open data community? How has open data changed the practices of grassroots movements?
    Open data internationally: What impact is open data having in different countries? How is open data supporting transparency as well as participatory engagement?
    Open data and democracy: How is open data being used to support democratic engagement, or impacting upon the democratic sphere?
    Open data as a tool for research: exploring how open data can be used in research, and tools for open data-driven research.


### Open Knowlege/ Wikipedia

    Wiki research: How do wikis, and the Wikimedia wikis in particular, operate? Which processes scale and which ones don’t? What kinds of people or social structures are well-suited to wikis? How does introducing a wiki into existing project groups change group dynamics?
    Wiki sociology: What motivates Wikimedians and what drives them away? Who are they, anyway? And where do they come from?
    Wiki critics: Critical positions are welcome: why Wikipedia will never be an encyclopedia, why Wikinews can never substitute newspapers, why amateurs shouldn’t be allowed to edit, and so forth.
    Wiki technology ideas: What can we do to address perceived and real problems, for example, peer review? How can we provide better-nuanced or more immediate user feedback?
    Wiki software ideas: What cutting edge wiki technology is out there? How can wikis be designed to fit better into corporate, political, legal, or other environments?
    Wiki community ideas: How can we deal with small-scale and large-scale conflicts? How can we bring the community closer together and build a shared belief in our mission?
    Wiki project ideas: Which successful projects in your Wikimedia project exist that other languages and projects don’t know about? What new projects may we want to start?
    Wiki content ideas: How could content be distributed to places that do not have Internet access? What other content creators could we cooperate with?
    Multimedia: How do we get photographers and artists involved? Which existing communities should we tap into?
    Free knowledge: How far are we from a world of free scientific journals? What can be done to get more existing knowledge under a free license? How can we help to preserve and distribute this knowledge, and provide universal access to it?
    Collaborative writing: What is the status of collaborative writing outside the wiki world (Everything2, H2G2, etc.)? Do wiki projects raise the writing skill of the people involved?
    Multilingualism: How can wikis help to bridge the subtle culture gaps
    across languages? How do other international bodies cope with language
    diversity? What linguistics uses are there for Wikimedia’s multilingual
    corpus? How should we handle minority languages?

WikiCulture & Community

There's a lot happening behind those articles; there's a huge, ever changing rabble that has somehow self organised to create something extraordinary. How did this happen? How does it work? Where's it headed? Can we improve it?
Technology, Interface & Infrastructure

Wikimedia is not just open content, but open source, and there are many significant changes that have happened, and are still to come.

You might like to consider attending the Hackathon, and submitting your session there, if you're looking primarily for a technical audience.
Legal & Free Culture

Making the world's content free! What does this mean? Why is it important? What projects are people working on? Have you done something great with some free content?
GLAM & Outreach

Are you working with a GLAM's to release some content or access their expertise?
Education Outreach

How can Wikimedia be used in Education? Can students be valuable members of the
community?

## We will pick speakers in this priority :

1. National and International F/LOSS/open knowledge/open hardware speakers.
2. Status reports from local and regional hacklabs/lugs etc
3. Local regional developers presenting projects they are working on.

## Schedule

We have the Library from 9-6 on Sat and from 12-6 on Sunday. So we will
find some event to do outside of the lib from 9-12 in the city before
they open. That

We will have one meeting room, which will be split that up into 2 hour
workshops during the day.

Here are the slots of time available across the two rooms.

Each of these talks will have 5 minutes before and after for setup, so you have 50 minutes for them.
So that is a total of 11 talks, 5 workshops, two keynotes and a round table.

## Venue

We have a green room in the auditorium that could serve as a ready
room. We have two wireless lavaliere mics and a handheld wireless mic
in the auditorium as well as a projector and screen. In Meeting Room C
we have a big screen TV that can be connected to a laptop. The room is
small enough a mic set up isn't necessary.

## Register your talk
