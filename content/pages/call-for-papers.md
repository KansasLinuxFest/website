##What is Kansas Linux Fest?
Kansas Linux Fest is a new festival of Free/Libre Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge.

The Kansas Linux Fest will be held for the first time on the 21st and 22nd of March 2015, in Lawrence Kansas. The goal is to establish a yearly conference where members of the F/LOSS community can meet and share for the Heartland. The next closest Linux Fest is in Ohio and there is no other within 12 hours driving from here.
Kansas Linux Fest is organized into two days of talks and workshops in parallel. We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their work.

Speakers should be judged by a committee represented by local and international F/LOSS/OK/OH

## We will pick speakers in this priority :

1. National and International F/LOSS/open knowledge/open hardware speakers.
2. Status reports from local and regional hacklabs/lugs etc
3. Local regional developers presenting projects they are working on.

## Schedule

We have the Library from 9-6 on Sat and from 12-6 on Sunday. So we will
find some event to do outside of the lib from 9-12 in the city before
they open. That

We will have one meeting room, which will be split that up into 2 hour
workshops during the day.

Here are the slots of time available across the two rooms.

## Venue

We have a green room in the auditorium that could serve as a ready
room. We have two wireless lavaliere mics and a handheld wireless mic
in the auditorium as well as a projector and screen. In Meeting Room C
we have a big screen TV that can be connected to a laptop. The room is
small enough a mic set up isn't necessary.
