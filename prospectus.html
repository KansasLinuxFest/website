            Open Source Software and Open Knowledge in the state of Kansas.</p>
          <p>There are a large number of groups in Kansas and the surrounding areas,
            the <b>FLOSOKAKS </b>will work with them together and aims to create a
            state wide organization that has members who represent all local

            <h2>What is Kansas Linux Fest?</h2>Kanas Linux Fest is a new festival of
            Free/Libre Open Source Software, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge.The Kansas
            Linux Fest will be held for the first time on the 21st and 22nd of March
            2015, in Lawrence Kansas.
          <p> The goal is to establish a yearly conference where
            members of the F/LOSS community can meet and share for the Heartland. The next
            closest Linux Fest is in Ohio and there is no other within 12 hours driving
            from here.Kansas Linux Fest is organized into two days of talks and
            workshops in parallel.<p> We will have talks from F/LOSS experts from around the
            word, from the region and local developers and communities presenting their
            work.
            
            <h3>Demand for a conference</h3>
          <p>The F/LOSS community continues to grow, and in Kansas and the surrounding states
            there is a large amount of activity. The adoption rate of Linux and F/LOSS
            software is high. The high demand for people with F/LOSS expertise shows that
            we need to do more here in Kanas to raise awareness about the benefits of this
            great community.            
          </p>
          
          <h3>Goals for the conference</h3>          
          <p>We want to create a yearly event that helps strengthen the
          F/LOSS community here in Kansas. </p>
            
          <h4>Keep costs down for attendees</h4>
          We want to have a free event so that people will not have to pay for entrance
          fee. We will ask for voluntary donations. Any excess funds from the conference
          will be used to buy food and drinks for the group.
          
          <h4>Spending</h4>
          Sponsors help pay for marketing, t-shirts, event space, even
          coffee/tea and lunches if enough funds
          are available.
          We will consider helping pay travel expenses for contributors who
          otherwise would not be able to attend. 

          <h4>Marketing</h4>
          We plan on doing marketing to get the word out, print advertising in regional newspapers, media press releases,
          posters, online (google, twitter, facebook, linked in) as well as organic
          marketing efforts.
          We think that promotion and marketing is very important for the
          conference and we want to do a great job on that.
          We will also be printing up posters and flyers to distribute at the
          cities, schools and universities in Kansas.

          <h4>Design</h4>
          We want to have teeshirts printed and have a nice design for them,
          ideally for the website as well. We are looking for help on the
          design side and do not yet have a designer on the project.

          <h4>Website</h4>
          We will want to get ssl certificates and also hosting for a dynamic website for managing the registration of guests, speaker, talks and
          schedules. Until then we will continue with a static website hosted
          on github.
